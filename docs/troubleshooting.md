# Troubleshooting

## 1. ENV and Configs in Corecos - Preview Mode
1. Run this script to update ENV and Configs to the bundle: `bun preview`
2. (WIP) Or use the `File Watcher` extension (appulate.filewatcher) for auto-updating ENV and Configs to the bundle.
    - Note: You need to install this extension in VSCode first.
